This data contains information on the fuel economy of new light-duty vehicle sales in major automotive markets and underpins the report - trends in the global vehicle fleet 2023: managing the SUV shift and the EV transition â€“ this report is the 2023 installment of the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (https://www.globalfueleconomy.org/) which, among other things, tracks progress in the efficiency of the global vehicle fleet. Yearly vehicle sales are defined by segment (small car, medium car, large car, small SUV, large SUV, Light Commercial Vehicle) and powertrain ( internal combustion engine, mild hybrid, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery electric, fuel cell hydrogen). For each combination of segment and powertrain the data contains information on sales, average weight (kg), average footprint (m2), and average specific energy consumption (lge/kwh). The data was obtained from a set of sources and processed to gain the best possible estimate of global trends in energy consumption for light duty vehicles. More information on the methodologies underpinning the data analysis can be found in the report at: https://www.globalfueleconomy.org/data-and-research/publications/trends-in-the-global-vehicle-fleet-2023 or doi:10.7922/G2HM56SV .
