This data contains information on the attributes and fuel economy of newly-sold light-duty vehicles in major automotive markets, as used in the report “Trends in the global vehicle fleet 2023: managing the SUV shift and the EV transition” (https://doi.org/10.7922/G2HM56SV).

The report is the 2023 installment of the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (https://globalfueleconomy.org) which, among other things, tracks progress in the efficiency of the global vehicle fleet.

The data have dimensions AREA, SEGMENT, POWERTRAIN, and YEAR; the second and third are enumerated by the code lists with the same IDs. There are four data flows, one for each MEASURE, and one data set for each flow.
The data were obtained from a set of sources and processed to gain the best possible estimate of global trends in energy consumption for light duty vehicles.
The report provides further information on the upstream sources and methods for data analysis.
